# About the *Ralstonia*  Wilt Dashboard

Welcome to the *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard, a comprehensive tool designed to explore and analyze the genetic diversity of *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC).

Our purpose is to communicate public data to stakeholders through a user-friendly dashboard that visualizes: 

- Geographic distribution patterns of *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC) lineages
- Patterns of *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC) host range 

The *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard integrates data from hundreds of sources. Please read our companion pre-print on BioRxiv for more details: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.189936

## Reporting Errors or Bugs

Any issues, questions, or comments about the dashboard can be directed to the *Ralstonia*-dashboard issue tracker on github or to the google form linked at the top of this page.

## How to Use

Navigate through the dashboard using the menu options. Each section provides specific tools and visualizations to explore different aspects of *Ralstonia* diversity. Hover over data points for more information, and use the filter options to customize your view.

## About the Team 

This dashboard is a collaboration between the [Lowe-Power Lab at UC Davis](https://lowepowerlab.ucdavis.edu) and the Data Intensive Biology lab at UC Davis. Version 1 of the *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard was developed by **Vienna Elmgreen**, with map geocoding assistance by **Benjamin Ramirez**, under guidance by **Dr. Tessa Pierce-Ward** and **Dr. Tiffany Lowe-Power**. 

## Acknowledgments

We gratefully acknowledge the researchers around the world who have shared their *Ralstonia* survey data through publications. We are grateful to [Dr. Emerson Del Ponte](https://emersondelponte.netlify.app/) for sharing R code for the [*Fusarium graminearum* species complex Db](https://fgsc.netlify.app/).

Funding for this database was provided in part by USDA APHIS, USDA NIFA, and the Department of Plant Pathology at UC Davis.
