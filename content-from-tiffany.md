## How to Interpret this Map
This map shows the reported isolation locations of *Ralstonia*, and each datapoint should be regarded with healthy skepticism. Isolation of *Ralstonia* at a location does not mean it is currently established at that location; eradication has been successful in certain cases (e.g. in Sweden) and some isolations might be from imported plants that were quarantined/destroyed. Additionally, our meta-analysis database likely contains a low incidence of errors from the primary literature, from our data entry, or from the geocoding algorithm that assigned latitude/longitude coordinates to written locations.

# About the *Ralstonia*  Wilt Dashboard

Welcome to the *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard, a comprehensive tool designed to explore and analyze the genetic diversity of Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC).

Our purpose is to communicate public data to stakeholders through a user-friendly dashboard that visualizes: 

- Geographic distribution patterns of *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC) lineages
- Patterns of *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC) host range 

The *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard integrates data from hundreds of sources. Please read our companion pre-print on BioRxiv for more details: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.189936

## Reporting Errors or Bugs

Any issues, questions, or comments about the search can be directed to the Ralstonia-dashboard issue tracker on github.

## How to Use

Navigate through the dashboard using the menu options. Each section provides specific tools and visualizations to explore different aspects of Ralstonia diversity. Hover over data points for more information, and use the filter options to customize your view.

## About the Team 

This dashboard is a collaboration between the [Lowe-Power Lab at UC Davis](https://lowepowerlab.ucdavis.edu) and the Data Intensive Biology lab at UC Davis. Version 1 of the *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard was developed by **Vienna Elmgreen** and **Benjamin Ramirez** under guidance by **Dr. Tessa Pierce-Ward** and **Dr. Tiffany Lowe-Power**. 

## Acknowledgments

We gratefully acknowledge the researchers around the world who have shared their *Ralstonia* survey data through publications. We are grateful to [Dr. Emerson Del Ponte](https://emersondelponte.netlify.app/) for sharing R code for the [Fusarium graminearum species complex Db](https://fgsc.netlify.app/).

Funding for this database was provided in part by USDA APHIS, USDA NIFA, and the Department of Plant Pathology at UC Davis.
