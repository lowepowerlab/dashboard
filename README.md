## To try out the template:

### 1. On the command line:

Copy the configuration template to a local config file
```
cp config-template.yml config.yml
```
Then, edit `config.yml` to contain the and path to your local data file

### 2. In R:

Install libraries if needed, then run:

```
shiny::runApp('rssc-dashboard.R')
```
> This should launch a local viewer, as long as `rssc-dashboard.R` is in your local working directory.
