# *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard & *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC) Global Diversity Database

## Background
Welcome to the *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard, a comprehensive tool designed to explore and analyze the genetic diversity of *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC). The *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC) are a diverse group of soil and waterborne pathogens that causes wilt and rot diseases of many economically important plant species. The species complex has been sub-divided into three distinct genomospecies: *R. solanacearum*, *R. pseudosolanacearum*, and *R. syzygii*. Different RSSC lineages emerged and diversified on distinct continents: *R. solanacearum* in the Americas, *R. syzygii* in the SE Asian archipelagoes (e.g. Indonesia), the phylotype I branch of *R. pseudosolanacearum* in continental Asia, and the phylotype III branch of *R. pseudosolanacearum* in Africa.
RSSC are broad-host range, generalist pathogens where individual strains have complex patterns of host range. Because most lineages that infect economically important crop plants can also cause latent infections of ornamental plants, latent infections of clonally propagated ornamental plants facilitate the transmission of exotic RSSC to new countries. The *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard integrates data from hundreds of sources. Please read our companion pre-print on BioRxiv for more details: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.189936

## Purpose
- Communicate public data to stakeholders through a dashboard that visualizes geographic distribution patterns of *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC) lineages and patterns of *Ralstonia solanacearum* species complex (RSSC) host range 
- To build a framework for understanding how and where exotic RSSC lineages can enter, establish, and spread in the U.S. 
- To develop an interactive dashboard that provides user-friendly access to host, location, and other already collected pathogen metadata on thousands of RSSC strains

## Goals
- This interactive dashboard summarizes RSSC data in accessible maps, charts, and tables for stakeholders to explore.
- Maps will highlight the geographic distribution of isolated RSSC strains by phylotype. The interactive features will allow stakeholders to color strain data points by taxonomic classification (phylotypes or sequevars) or by host (plant species or botanical families) and to filter strain data points by year and geographic location.
- Charts will visualize strain data in stacked bar charts and pie charts to display phylotype and host range data. 
- Tables will display strain data and the interactive features will allow stakeholders to search and filter data to desired specifications.
- Vegetatively propagated plant tissues are the main risk for long-distance movement of RSSC. We will have a tab that focuses on vegetatively propagated crops (potato, Musa sp. [banana/plantain], Zingiber rhizomes [ginger, turmeric], and ornamentals [e.g. geranium, pothos, anthurium, rose, etc.]).

## Reporting Errors or Bugs
- Any issues, questions, or comments about the dashboard can be directed to the *Ralstonia*-dashboard issue tracker on our github or to the Google form linked at the top of the dashboard webpage.

## About the Team 
- This dashboard is a collaboration between the [Lowe-Power Lab at UC Davis](https://lowepowerlab.ucdavis.edu) and the Data Intensive Biology lab at UC Davis. Version 1 of the *Ralstonia* Wilt Dashboard was developed by **Vienna Elmgreen**, with location geocoding assistance by **Benjamin Ramirez**, under guidance by **Dr. Tessa Pierce-Ward** and **Dr. Tiffany Lowe-Power**.
